My name is Willem Melching. I'm from Amsterdam, The Netherlands, but currently live in San Diego.

I created this blog to post about some of my projects that I thought are cool. Most of them will be about programming, electronics, car hacking and reverse engineering.

During the day I work on [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) for [comma.ai](https://comma.ai).
